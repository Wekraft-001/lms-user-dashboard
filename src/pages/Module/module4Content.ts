      content: `National PPR systems offer multiple entry points for community-led monitoring. Understanding these opportunities is essential for sustainable integration.

<b>Key Entry Points:</b>

<ul>
<li><b>National Action Plans for Health Security (NAPHS):</b> CLM can inform NAPHS development and monitor implementation</li>
<li><b>JEE and SPAR processes:</b> Community evidence can validate and supplement official assessments</li>
<li><b>Emergency operations:</b> CLM can provide real-time community feedback during health emergencies</li>
<li><b>Health sector governance:</b> Community representatives can participate in technical working groups and oversight committees</li>
</ul>

<b>Building the Case for Integration:</b>

<ol>
<li>Demonstrate CLM's value through documented improvements</li>
<li>Align CLM with existing policy frameworks and commitments</li>
<li>Identify champions within government and partner organizations</li>
<li>Propose specific, practical integration mechanisms</li>
